<z><z><z><big>Skin Care</big>
<h2><br>
<b>1.	I have oily skin. Do I still need a moisturizer?<br></b>
<y>• Yes, moisturizers play a vital role in a daily skin care regimen. If the skin is lacking <y><y>moisture, the sebaceous glands (oil secreting glands in the skin) produce more oil, making <y><y>skin more oily.<br>
<br>

<b>2.	Why do I need special products for the eye area?<br></b>
<y>• The tissue around the eye is the thinnest on the body and therefore will show the first signs <y><y>of aging. It is important to treat this delicate area differently with a specific eye treatment <br>
<br>
<b>3.	Do I need to wear a sunscreen every day, even while at work and in the winter?<br></b>
<y>• Yes, always protect your skin with sunscreen. UVA and UVB rays penetrate through <y><y>windows and glass. <br>
<br>
<b>4.	Is there any way to make pores look smaller?<br></b>
<y>• Although your pore size is genetically determined, a buildup of oil, dirt, and dead cells <y><y>can enlarge them. You can incorporate products containing glycolic and salicylic acid into <y><y>your daily regimen to minimize the appearance of pores.<br> <br> 
<b>5.	Why do I need to use a different product at night than I do during the day?<br></b>
<y>• During night time, skin is protected from sunlight as well as harmful environmental <y><y>factors. So we can use stronWe like to think of nighttime as “treatment time.” It is when <y><y>you should put lots of beneficial ingredients into the skin for maximum penetration without <y><y>any harmful environmental factors getting in the way. <br>
<br>
<b>6.   What's the best general care for my skin?<br>
<y> • Here are a few simple steps that most people can take to care for and protect their skin:<br>
<y><y>1.	Use a gentle, non-drying cleanser twice a day, everyday, for your face and body.<br>
<y><y>2.	Apply a moisturizer to hydrate skin on your face and body daily.</br>
<y><y>3. To reduce the risk of premature skin-aging and skin cancer, protect your skin from the <y><y><y>damaging rays of the sun by using a sunscreen (SPF 15 or higher)<br> 
<y><y>4. When outside every day, wearing protective clothing outdoors, and avoiding &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <y><y><y>overexposure to the sun and tanning beds/salons.<br>
 <y><y>5. In addition, proper skin care should also include seeing a dermatologist.<br>
<br>

<b>7.  What causes everyday rashes, and how can they be treated?<br>
<y> • Everyday rashes can be caused by a number of things, from heat to insect bites to allergic <y><y>reactions. The following care can help address dry skin and itching:<br>
<y> <y> 1.	Shower or bathe in warm, not hot, water. Use a gentle soap-free cleanser that won't <y><y><w>over-dry the skin. <br>
<y> <y> 2.	Use a moisturizer daily to help break the dry skin and itch cycle. <br>
<br>
<b>8.  When should I use a sunscreen?<br>
<y> • To help protect your skin from the damaging rays of the sun, dermatologists recommend <y><y>wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher <y><y>every day in all seasons, on both cloudy and clear days.
A broad-spectrum sunscreen <y><y>helps protect your skin from both UVA (aging) and UVB (burning) rays. UVA rays are <y><y>believed to be responsible for photoaging (the damage that occurs to the skin from many <y><y>years of exposure to the sun). It's important to protect your skin from incidental sun <y><y>exposure like while you're driving in the car, walking outside, etc.
Apply sunscreen to all <y><y>exposed skin, including lips, ears, backs of hands, and neck. Apply sunscreen generously <y><y>and evenly before going in the sun, and reapply frequently after swimming, exercising, or <y><y>sweating. It's also important to look for a sunscreen product that is water resistant.<br>
<br>
<b>9.   What is the difference between a wrinkle and a fine line?<br></b>
<y>• A wrinkle is defined as a crease or furrow in the skin caused by the natural process of <y><y>aging, by excessive exposure to the sun's damaging rays, or environmental insults. If you <y><y>stretch a wrinkle, you will still see it. However, a fine line (or “expression line“) is a <y><y>small wrinkle that may be caused by the contraction of facial muscles during smiling or <y><y>frowning. When you stretch the skin of a fine line, the lines are barely visible.
<br>
<br>
<b>10.   Will a facial moisturizer with sunscreen provide enough protection?<br></b>
<y> • It is important to wear sunscreen every day to protect your skin from the harmful rays of <y><y>the sun. Therefore, it's important to choose a moisturizer that offers broad-spectrum UVA <y><y>and UVB sun protection. Most wrinkles come from UVA (aging) rays, while UVB <y><y>(burning) rays are the main cause of sunburn and skin cancer.<br>
<br>
<b>11.  What causes dry skin, and what can I do to improve it?<br></b>
<y> • When skin is dehydrated, the water content of the very top layer of skin is reduced, <y><y>causing it to shrink. This shrinkage creates many of the familiar symptoms of dry skin, <y><y>including itching, scaling, loss of elasticity and tightness. Scratching further damages the <y><y>skin, leaving it vulnerable to infection.<br>
<y> • Some causes of dry skin include:<br>
<y><y>1.	Overheated rooms<br>
<y><y>2.	Low humidity<br>
<y><y>3.	Cold winter air<br>
<y><y>4.	Excessive sun<br>
<y><y>5.	Too much soap and water, which washes away natural oils<br>
<y><y>6.	Cleansing in hot water<br>
<y> • Tips you can incorporate to relieve your dry skin:<br>
<y><y>1.	Shower or bathe in warm, not hot, water. Use a gentle soap-free cleanser that won't <y><y><w>over-dry the skin. <br>
<y><y>2.	 Apply a moisturizer immediately after bathing to replenish and seal in the moisture. <br>
<br>
 
<b>12.  What causes razor bumps or ingrown hairs?<br></b>
<y>• Hair grows from follicles in the skin. When shaved, the tip of the hair is left with a sharp <y><y>point. As curly hair grows, this sharp point may emerge from the hair follicle, curve back <y><y>and pierce the skin. The body reacts to and treats these ingrown hairs just as it would to <y><y>other foreign body, producing a pimple-like bump. Razor bumps can also form when <y><y>shaving too close to skin. This allows hair to penetrate the side of the hair follicle instead <y><y>of following its normal path to the skin's surface. This occurs more frequently when the <y><y>hair follicle is curved. Once razor bumps are formed, continual shaving cuts and slices <y><y>existing bumps, resulting in a painful and uneven shave and possible worsening of the <y><y>condition.
<br>
<br>
 
<b>13.  What can you do to minimize razor bumps when you shave? <br></b>
<y> • Try shaving every other day, and don't shave too closely. Choosing a razor specially made <y><y>for razor bumps is also helpful. This type of razor cuts the hair at the right length to reduce <y><y>the likelihood that the hair tip will re-enter the skin.. In addition, be sure to wet hair with <y><y>warm water to soften it before shaving. <br><br>

<b>14. What are fever blisters?<br></b>
<y>•   Fever blisters are very common skin disease caused herpes simplex virus. A variety of <y><y>factors can contribute to this virally related condition including over exposure to UV light, <y><y>illness or fever, menstruation, physical or emotional stress and fatigue, etc. Initially <y><y>blisters are found on the  around lip area, which can gradually become ulcers
